<h2>Brief history of the Omurice</h2>
<p>
    Omurice or omu-rice (オムライス, Omu-raisu) is an example of yōshoku (a Western-influenced fusion style Japanese cuisine) consisting of an omelette made with fried rice and thin, fried scrambled eggs, usually topped with ketchup.
</p>
The true origins of omurice are unclear, but it allegedly made its debut in the year 1900 (the 33rd year of the Meiji Era) at a famous Western-style restaurant in Ginza, Tokyo, called Renga-tei. The idea was to make a dish that could be easily eaten with one hand while working in a busy kitchen.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup (6 ounces) mixture of green and red bell peppers, cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped celery</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped carrot</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Paprika</li>
    <li>5 white mushrooms, cut into chunks</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (4 to 5 ounces) chopped onion</li>
    <li>1 Garlic Clove (Finely Minced)</li>
    <li>1 smoked sausage (4 ounces), chopped</li>
    <li>a few chunks of aged cheddar cheese (optional)</li>
    <li>1 green chili pepper, chopped (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup cooked rice</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <h4>Make the Fried Rice</h4>
    <li>Heat up a large pan. Add butter, sausage and garlic and stir for 1 minute until the garlic turns a little crispy.</li>
    <li>Add the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, celery, carrot, mushroom, and onion. Stir a few minutes until the onion turns a little translucent.</li>
    <li>Stir in ¼ teaspoon kosher salt and the ½ teaspoon of black pepper.</li>
    <li>Add the rice, ketchup, and mix it well. Let it cook without stirring for a minute, so that the bottom of the rice gets a little crunchy. Stir it again.</li>
    <li>Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>Transfer the fried rice to a bowl that can fit all of it, plus a bit more. Fill it about halfway with the fried rice, then if you’re using cheddar cheese stash it in there before filling the rest of the bowl.</li>
    <li>If you’re using chopped green chili pepper, put it on top. Gently press everything down with a spoon so that it’ll mold nicely to the inside of the bowl.</li>
</ol>
<ol>   
    <h4>Make the Omelette:</h4>
    <li>Beat 2 eggs in a bowl with ¼ teaspoon kosher salt and sugar.</li>
    <li>Put a strainer over another bowl and strain the egg mixture through, to make it smooth, remove any lumps, and to catch the chalazae (white thing that hangs off the yolk).</li>
    <li>Heat up a non-stick pan. Add vegetable oil and swirl the oil around so it covers the pan. Then wipe off the excess heated oil with a paper towel so only a thin layer remains. Turn down the heat to medium low, so we don’t burn or brown the egg at all.</li>
    <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan and swirl the pan around to make a nice round circle. Keep moving the pan around and let the low heat cook the egg until it doesn’t flow anymore. Remove from the heat.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <h4>Put it Together</h4>
    <li>Put a large plate over the bowl of stir-fried rice. Flip everything over and remove the bowl, so you have a perfect dome of fried rice.</li>
    <li>Place the omelette over top of the dome. Tuck the edges close under the rice.</li>
    <li>Top with a bit of ketchup and or any other garnish you like, and serve.</li>
